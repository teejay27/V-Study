# V Study: Virtual Study Platform (Hack-o-uplift)
Online education in the times of pandemic has left a lot of students alone in their homes, devoiding them of a potential enhancing peer community. People are now more distracted, unfocussed than ever and now have, significantly reduced concentration spans. As a part of the Hack-o-uplift hackathon, we have come up with the idea (and prototype) of a Virtual Study Platform that will cater to all major needs of a student, from maintaining and working in a peer community to organising useful resources at one place. The major features of website includes:

1. Subject/Field wise Study Rooms to focus.
2. Compilation of all useful study resources at one place
3. Easy to annotate Magic Notes/ List
4. Integrated Pomodoro Focus Timers
5. Browser tolerance to avoid distractions from certain websites (mostly social media)
In short, V Study will act as a one stop solution for all people looking to improve their productivity levels at work and mostly, learning.
